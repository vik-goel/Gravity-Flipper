Gravity-Flipper
===============

Gravity Flipper is a game made for ludum dare 30. 
The entire game was made in under 48 hours. 
This is my first time entering this competition.

In this game you control two characters which are both trapped in different worlds.
The only thing connecting the two worlds is you. 
You must keep both characters alive by reversing their gravity.

Unfortunately, both of the worlds are connected.
Reversing one world's gravity will also reverse the others.

Click the mouse to reverse gravity. 

Good luck!
